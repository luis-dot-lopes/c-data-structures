# Data structures in C

This repository contains the implementations of some data structures and some algorithms in C.

Also, these implentations are not to be considered a good reference. They are my attempt at implementing
the algorithms and data structures after getting a vague idea about them.

Data structures implemented so far:

- Linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Unrolled linked list
- Dynamic array
- Stack
- Binary Search Tree
- Red-Black Tree

Algorithms implemented:

- Quicksort
- Binary Search
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heapsort
